# Coursera_Capstone
I will be working on data provided by Foursquare in the project "The battle of neighborhoods". Last course of the IBM profesional specialization in data science.

The purpose of this project is to use machine learning clustering methods. Data will be managed and preprocessed with Python Pandas, all of which is carried out in Jupyter Notebooks.
